* IR-Sensors -> cellular rubber
* IR-Sensors -> sensitivity, directionality
* E-Puck lib total crap -> rewritten
* Bluetooth: No info when sent -> empiric results
* LPS: image processing too slow -> faster implementation
* prox values -> re-measure
* IR-Sensors increase width
* VICTOR too heavy -> lose weight
* Interrupt priorities -> cannot use asserts in ISR -> changed priorities (changes real time guarantee, still in limit)
* No ground sensors
* Batteries drained empty in no time.
* Pickup process cumbersome -> cannot steal victim from broken down TB
* Construction of {custom extension board, victim board}
* HAL for working with MatLab _and_ real E-Puck -> re-use MatLab tests
* w.r.t risk analysis: myriads of point of failure
* Debugging by setting different modes
* Imprecision of the IR-Sensors: Minor deviations result in huge search spaces for the victim
* Memory limitations -> Compact Map
* Compact Map -> Map merge in interrupt
* Map merge in interrupt takes too much time -> optimizations on assembly level, i.e. counting instructions, minimizing them
