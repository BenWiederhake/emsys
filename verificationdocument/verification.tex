\section{Overview}

On a grand scheme the software is divided into the following subcomponents:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Controller
	\item Traffic Cop Eyes
	\item Blind Traffic Cop 
	\item RHR
	\item Victim Direction
	\item Victim Finder
	\item Path Finder
	\item Path Executor
	\item Pickup Artist
\end{itemize}

Each of those components is subject of one or more test strategies either for
the whole component at once, or their subcomponents separately.
\subsection{Controller}
\subsubsection{Purpose}
	Connects each component's inputs and outputs. \todo[inline]{a little more}
\teststrat{Controller}{
    The correct connection between the Tin Bot's different subcomponents, \ie,
    the correct overall behavior for a single Tin Bot without taking any T2T
    connection into account.
}{
    Maze, Victim, one Tin Bot including all LEDs, LPS, debug monitor.
}{
    Setup the maze. Place the victim and the Tin Bot inside appropriately. Setup
    the LPS and make sure that a Bluetooth connection between the LPS, the Tin
    Bot, and the debug monitor is established. Turn on the E-Puck and evaluate
    the behavior based on movements and visual feedback by the LEDs.
}{
    Correctness of subcomponents separately is not tested, because they are
    covered in other, more appropriate test cases. Moreover, the T2T connection
    is not tested for the same reasoning.
}
%
\subsection{Traffic Cop Eyes}
\subsubsection{Purpose}
Connects sensor data with remaining components. Issues requests for other components to start their work.
\todo[inline]{elaborate a bit}
\teststrat{Traffic Cop Eyes}{
    Correct behavior based on given sensor data.
}{
    Part \rom{1}: MatLab, compiled code. Part \rom{2}: Full Setup, \ie, LPS,
    victim, Tin Bot(s), debug monitor, maze.
}{
    Part \rom{1}: Run the test cases from the virtual prototype, but use actual
    compiled code instead of the Simulink model. Check for correctness based
    on the output. \\
    Part \rom{2}: Run full process, check for ignorance towards incoming signals
    even though the intended behavior dictates a reaction. 
}{
    There are no unit tests for this component due to its importance and
    simplicity. So bugs are unlikely and close to impossible to remain
    unnoticed.
}
%
\subsection{Blind Traffic Cop:}
\subsubsection{Purpose}
An arbiter for the subcomponents.
\teststrat{Blind Traffic Cop}{
    Correct arbitration of the access to the motors.
}{
    Full Setup.
}{
    In terms of an integration test. Each component has a signature behavior and
    their distinction is clear, so a conflict or an incorrect arbitration can be
    spotted easily.
}{
    It is not tested, whether the controller actually uses the Blind Cop's
    output or decides on its own. If it were so the Tin Bot's behavior would be
    spurious, or correct. In the latter case, we would assume the Blind Cop to
    be correct, even though it is not used at all.
}
%
\subsection{Right-Hand Rule}
\subsubsection{Purpose}
Implementation of the right-hand rule.
\teststrat{Right-Hand-Rule Obedience}{
    The Tin Bot is supposed to walk straight until sensing a wall. Then, it
    should follow it having the wall on its right-hand side.
}{
    Tin Bot, LPS, debug monitor, maze.
}{
    Setup the LPS and the maze. Place a single Tin Bot in the maze and turn it
    on. Start the Tin Bot and wait an appropriate amount of time based on the
    maze's layout.

    Check debug data for disagreements with the intended behavior.
}{
    Collision avoidance is not tested on a detailed level, i.e. scraping along
    the wall will not be detectable. This, however, is subject of a dedicated
    test.
}
%
\subsection{Victim Direction}
\subsubsection{Purpose}
Turns the E-Puck and computes angle/position to the victim.
\teststrat{Victim Directing toggling}{
    When a signal from the victim is received, the victim direction components
    is supposed to be toggled. Only after having traveled an appropriate amount
    of time, another measurement should be initiated.
}{
    Victim, maze, LPS, Tin Bot.
}{
    Setup the maze as well as the LPS. Place the victim and the
    Tin Bot in the
    maze and turn them on. Wait for the Tin Bot to receive a signal and check
    for the component's signature movement, \ie, turning a full circle.

    Wait for the second measurement to be fully performed, then turn off the Tin
    Bot and measure the traveled distance.
}{
    The correctness of the signals and the output are not tested, because they
    are subject of their own test cases.
}
Testing: Done. In MatLab, Unit tests, as well as on the actual E-Puck. Problems: Reflecting caused by the struts. Very prone to reflections by nearby gazers or changing lighting conditions. Solution: Using cellular rubber (thanks to Peter!) to absorb rather than reflect the signal. Solution is tested in parts.

\teststrat{Victim Direction Computation}{
    Victim direction is supposed to approximate the normalized angle from its
    current position to the victim. The computation's correctness is tested
    here.
}{
    Part \rom{1}: MatLab, compiled code.
    Part \rom{2}: LPS, debug monitor, Tin Bot, victim.
}{
    Part \rom{1}: Start test case from virtual prototype in MatLab, but use
    compiled code
    instead of Simulink model. Check the output.
    Part \rom{2}: Setup the LPS, place and turn on the Tin Bot as well as the
    victim. Make sure a Bluetooth connection between the debug monitor, the Tin
    Bot, and the LPS has been established. 

    Run the Tin Bot, wait until a measurement has been completed, and the result
    has been sent to the debug monitor. Check for approximative correctness.
}{
    Bluetooth connection and correctness of signals are not tested. The former
    one is assumed to be correct, the latter one is subject to its own test
    cases.
}

Victim Finder: 
Starts victim direction. Manages gathered data about the victim, i.e. discards old information and start computation for new data accordingly.
Implementation: Done / in debug phase. 
Testing: Unit tests done, MatLab running, on actual E-Puck unknown, assumed to be fine, though.

Path Finder: 
Computes a path from the current position to the victim based on the internal map consisting of data gathered via proximity sensors and other Tin Bot's broadcasts.
Implementation: State Machine done, search algorithm will be changed from A* to Bellman-Ford.
Testing: State Machine and A* are tested via unit tests, Bellman-Ford is about to be implemented and will be subject to appropriate unit tests. Memory overhead has been considered for both algorithms and static guarantees allow us to deem the algorithm correct in this respect. On MatLab: causes simulation to crash.

Path Executor:
Executes path given by path finder.
Implementation: done.
Testing: Untested.

Pickup Artist:
New component. Activated after path executor reports that the victim has been reached. Decides what actions to take to assure that we can pick up the victim securely and initialize the motion outwards.
Implementation: Not yet.
Testing: Untested.

Moreover, regarding communication, the data (de-)serialization is fully implemented and tested, both for communication with the LPS, and T2T.

\section{Hardware} 
The hardware is divides into two parts: The environment, and the connection
between the main components, \ie, the Raspberry Pi, and the E-Puck. 
The connection between the components and their respective sensors and actuators
is verified using the following test strategies.

\subsection{Connection Extension Board to E-Puck}

\teststrat{Custom Extension Board Connection Frequency}{
    We guarantee a real time upper bound on the frequency in which sensor data
    is received and can then be processed. The time between two received
    sensor data packages is \todo[inline]{FREQUENCY}ms.

    We test the frequency in which data is received and computed the maximal
    time needed for all interrupt service routine to run through, such that the
    stated frequency can be guaranteed.
}{
    Oscilloscope, custom extension board, E-Puck.
}{
    We directly measure the signals from the extension board sent using the
    i\textsuperscript{2}c protocol. We send signals to an IR-Sensor to see
    whether the received signal is correct.
}{
   We do not measure whether an amplitude is registered only if the signal is
   strong enough. The reason for this is that we regulate the signals stability
   on with software, therefore we do not mind the actual intensity. Moreover, we
   designed the IR-Sensors in a way that the sensitivity fits our needs based on
   empirical results.
}

\subsection{Connection between the Raspberry Pi as LPS and the E-Puck as Tin Bot
via Bluetooth}

\teststrat{LPS Update Frequency}{
    If the initial setup is completed, the LPS is supposed to send location data
    to the Tin Bot approximately every two seconds without any hard guarantees.
    However, the process of receiving and processing the data should not take
    more than three seconds. Progress in this regard is supposed to be signaled
    by toggling a designated LED.
}{
    LPS, debug monitor, Tin Bot with a designated LED.
}{
    Make sure the initial setup is completed, \ie, the debug monitor indicates a
    Bluetooth connection and the LPS has recognized the Tin Bot. Now, the time
    between toggles is measured and should not exceed three seconds.
}{
    The correctness of the LPS data is not tested. We assured that the data is
    correct in separate tests, though. Moreover, the location data has to be
    correct relative to the measured location data of other Tin Bots, which
    depends on the camera and is robust by construction.
}

\subsection{Victim}

\teststrat{Victim Actuators}{
    The victim shall send IR-Signals and a LED shall be on after turning the
    victim on. The signals shall be in agreement with the SOS-protocol.
}{
    Oscilloscope, Victim, Victim's power LED, IR-Sensors.
}{
    Turn on the victim and check the LED using visual feedback. Make sure that
    there is a clear sight between the victim and the IR-Sensors. Check the
    received signal using the oscilloscope and compare against the expected
    pattern.
}{
    We cannot test whether the signal originates at the victim or any other
    source, e.g.\ a malevolent agent turning on or off a nearby device using a
    similar signal.
}


All hardware
components are built. Communication protocols are
implemented and extensively tested. Empirical tests in terms of any other E-Puck
based test. - Communication frequency:    + I2C: Test case lighting LEDs after a
poll has been taken place.   + Bluetooth (to LPS): LED indicates when new data
has been received and processed.   + Bluetooth (T2T): Actual communication
untested.

The border has to be coated in cellular rubber, other than that, no further actions have to be applied.
