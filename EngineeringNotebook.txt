tutor’s recommendation: gps fails
tutor’s recommendation: radio/sound instead of IR -> epuck sound -> cartography less precise
microphone already in epuck, only sound emitter needed.
bluetooth communication between e-Pucks

Victim not on e-Puck -> use magnets instead and push them out.

hardware:

2 epuck, raspberry pi, charger missing, code transmitter
Micro usb for raspberry 

[webcam from Ben]
Camera from chair direct connection to Pi model 1

Picamera lib for python

SD card missing in Pi! -> ask Hazem -> we’ll get it later.
At least 8 GiB for now, maybe we need less.

Discuss how we want to combine Teddy and IR emitter.  ATmega8 should suffice? -> Agreed on ATtiny2313 + 4 IR emitter
Test whether “our” IR emitter works through various kinds of paper.
Normal paper -> IR goes through (bad)
3 sheets of paper -> still (bad)
Galaxy Tab2 cardboard -> doesn’t go through (good)

Marlene agreed to prepare 2mm Cardboard for walls.

How do we connect IR sensor and e-puck: We can remove top part of e-Puck and replace by own board. -> We need own board!

Problem: fast deployment for presentation when using pucks from other groups.
Idea: Remove board, screw perfboard (Lochrasterplatine) on top including our sensors and ATmega328p, prepare 3 such boards, so we can deploy within minutes. 
Problem: 10 volts from e-Puck is way too much -> need to reduce. Resistors not sufficient because of sending, thus using Max232x chip.

Connection including battery connection -> look @ wiki
For now: 3 x e-Puck connection cable

Discussion: Using sound instead of IR: Problem with triangulation.

Solution: e-Puck allows direct connection.

- No 5V batteries found.  Use 4.5V instead. (Should be fine, ATtiny + IR emitter is low-power.)
- RS232 connector is difficult to find and to implement -- avoid altogether?

- koehma said "I2C solves everything", apparently including the power supply
- started the specification file (no further notes here as all things are in the spec file)

- rückwärts fahren können!
- Magnets
- Proximity sensors to detect whether the teddy is still there
