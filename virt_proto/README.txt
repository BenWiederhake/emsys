Tin Bot â€“ Group 6
=================

Welcome to our virtual prototype.

Setup:
------
 1. Start Matlab and navigate to this folder.
 2. Execute `setup()` to setup the simulation environment.

Structure:
----------
 - library: custom Simulink blocks to build Tin Bot simulations
 - classes: Matlab classes used by the simulation
 - software: the "Software" components running on the physical Tin Bot
 - tests: various test cases for different components


Tests:
------
 - drive_test: test physical model of differential drive
    Quick, atomic
 - proximity_test: test physical model of proximity sensor
    Quick, atomic
 - ir_test: test physical model of IR sensor
    Quick, atomic
 - traffic_blind_test: test the "blind" part of the traffic cop
    Quick, atomic
 - victim_direction_test: test victim direction calculation
    Medium time, tests environment and bare-bone software component
 - path_finder_test: test internal map generation and escape path calculation
    Medium time, awesome visualization
 - approximator_test: test approximation of current position and orientation
    Slow, complete test of internal position and orientation approximation based on the
    motor speeds and reset of wrong data according to the LPS (crash into wall)
 - follow_right_hand_test: test right hand rule
    Very slow, nearly holistic
 - controller_test: test the complete control software
    Very slow, nearly holistic
